# Turing Pi 2 Kubernetes Test Project  

This project was created to explore and test Docker and Kubernetes using a **Turing Pi 2** with two nodes. The goal is to develop a simple yet functional application. Once complete, the application will provide an overview of my personal finances.

## Project Overview  

The setup includes:  
1. A **PostgreSQL** container for data storage.  
2. An **Apache Superset** container for data visualization and analytics.

By deploying these components, this project serves as a practical starting point for working with containerized applications in a Kubernetes environment.

## Why This Project?  

The Turing Pi 2 is an platform for building and testing small-scale Kubernetes clusters. This project combines essential technologies to explore:  
- **Cluster Management**: Setting up and orchestrating multiple containers.  
- **Persistent Storage**: Using PostgreSQL to handle structured data.  
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizing Apache Superset to generate interactive dashboards.
